## Important Information

- So far, we're going to write code for our current products. 

- Each folder containing a Product or it's Programs, has a .txt file with a brief description.

- Anyone can Read/Write.

- Examples will be put in example.file_extension.

- Mains will be put in main.file_extension.

- If you want to add a file, put your initials, initials_example.file_extension.

- Most files will be in assembly (.asm), then compiled and linked to an obeject (.o), and a binary (.bin) files.

- Remember, a computer only understands machine, 1s and 0s.

- I have a Discord Server where we can discuss. Ilios Selene's Reactor.

Nice Project!
