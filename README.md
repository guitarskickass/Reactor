## Important Information

- So far, we're going to write code for our current products. 

- Each folder containing a Product or it's Programs, has a .txt file with a brief description.

- Anyone can Read/Write.

- Examples will be put in example.file_extension.

- Mains will be put in main.file_extension.

- If you want to add a file, put your initials, initials_example.file_extension.

- Most files will be in assembly (.asm), then compiled and linked to an obeject (.o), and a binary (.bin) files.

- Remember, a computer only understands machine, 1s and 0s.

- I have a Discord Server where we can discuss. Ilios Selene's Reactor.

Nice Project!

## About me

- Religious Views, and Political Science: 
Christian Presbyterian, and Progressive Conservative 

- I'm going to be a Heavy Duty Mechanic in a Quartz mine for IUOE, and work my way up to a Multinational Conglomerate.
- Previous: Interior Systems Mechanic (schools, hospitals, casinos, court houses), Heat and Frost Mechanic (food, transportation, forestry, mining, chemical, oil & gas).

- Heavy Duty Mechanic, I'd be really good at it, since I'm good at/with Mechanics. I know about engines, headers, gaskets, fuel injectors, spark plugs, crank shafts, timing belts, alternators, batteries, thermostats, manifolds, exhausts, catalytics, transmissions, axles, differentials, hubs, breaks. 

- Study: Business Administration/Computer Science. 
- Industry: Business Management and IT. 
- Markets: Business, Computing. 
- Work: Entrepreneur/Cpu Systems Designer 
- Hobbies: Music and Sports 

- For Business, I'm going to stick with Quartz Mining, Silicon Production and Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Processor Fabrication (Supply Chain/Logistics). 
- For Computing, I'm going to stick with Electrical, Computer, Engineering, Architecture (Low Level Programming). 
- That way I can figure out how a computer is made and how much Materials, Equipment, Supplies I need to make em. 

Something like that!
